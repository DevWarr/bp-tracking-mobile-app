# Blood Pressure Tracker - Monitor and Manage Your Blood Pressure

Description:

Blood Pressure Tracker is a comprehensive app designed to help you monitor and manage your blood pressure effectively. Whether you have low blood pressure, healthy blood pressure, or are dealing with hypertension, this app provides the tools you need to easily enter your blood pressure data and track your recordings over time.

**NOTE:** This app will not take your blood pressure. You will still need a blood pressure monitor.

With Blood Pressure Tracker, you can log your blood pressure readings with ease. Enter your systolic and diastolic measurements, as well as your heart rate, and the app will track the information for you.

On the main page of the app, you can see a clear overview of your blood pressure history. Blood pressures are also color coded to help showcase whether the reading indicates low, healthy, or elevated blood pressure.

This is an early release of this app. Upcoming features include:

1. Blood Pressure Visualization: View your blood pressure data over on a graph, to see your blood pressure over time.
2. Export and Share: Export your blood pressure results as a CSV file to share with your healthcare provider or family members.
